    <h1>About Us</h1>

      <h2>Our closet</h2>
      <p>Originally, our topic was redesigning a shopping website. We believed we could make the usual
        shopping experience more interactive as well as visually appealing, and we wanted to bring in some
        elements we have seen on online dress up games. We began reminiscing about games we used to play
        when we were younger on the computer like the old Dollz Mania websites, Stardoll, and The Sims 2.
        We quickly decided to instead just make our own dress up game. Our Closet is inspired by the pixel
        dolls we used to make as kids and just nostalgic 1990s and 2000s toys and games. It is a shame the Dollz Mania website
        is no longer trustworthy or secure because of all the ads, pop ups, and shady links. </p>
