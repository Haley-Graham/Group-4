    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>Our closet</h2>
    <p>Originally, our topic was redesigning a shopping website. We believed we could make the usual
      shopping experience more interactive as well as visually appealing, and we wanted to bring in some
      elements we have seen on online dress up games. We began reminiscing about games we used to play
      when we were younger on the computer like the old Dollz Mania websites, Stardoll, and The Sims 2.
      We quickly decided to instead just make our own dress up game. <span style="font-weight:700">Our Closet</span> is a dress up game inspired by the pixel
      dolls we used to make as kids and other nostalgic 1990s and 2000s toys and games. It is a shame the Dollz Mania website
      is no longer trustworthy or secure because of all the ads, pop ups, and shady links. </p>

    <h3>Haley Graham</h3>
    <p>Hello I'm Haley! I am a Communication Design Major with a concentration in visual design at CSU Monterey Bay. I love art,
      plants, music, and coffee. I also have a kitty named Appa, he is a long-hair Siamese cat and he's the cutest! When I was
      younger I used to sneak into my older sister's room to play with her Bratz Dollz, I thought they were so cool with their
      fun outfits and crazy hair and makeup. I’m not surprised this sense of fashion and style has stuck with me.</p>

    <h3>Ayline Castrejon</h3>
    <p>I am a transfer from Cabrillo College. My major is Communication design with a concentration
            in Visual Design. Dress up games definitely are nostalgic for me. When I was younger, I would
            search “free dress up games” and I would have the most fun time dressing up dolls online.
